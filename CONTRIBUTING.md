# Contributing Document

Thanks for taking some time to check out this document, I hope it goes a long way
to helping you contribute to this repo.

## Quick Overview

First things first, this repo is mainly a catalog of all of The Renegade Coder's 
How to Python series content. The main purpose of this repo is to display
this content in an easy-to-read format in the main README. This README is 
currently automatically generated through a combination of GitHub Actions
an Python code.

However, in addition to the README, there are plenty of gold nuggest throughout
the repo. For example, the following folders feature additional content:

- Challenges: a list of all of the How to Python challenges with solutions and testing
- Notebooks: a list of all articles in Jupyter Notebook format
- Testing: a list of performance tests for all solutions

In the following subsections, we'll take a look at how you can contribute to each of
these collections.
