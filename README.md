# How to Python - Source Code

Welcome to a collection of Jupyter Notebooks from the [How to Python](https://therenegadecoder.com/series/how-to-python/) series on The Renegade Coder. For convenience, you can access all of the articles, videos, challenges, and source code below. Alternatively, I keep [an enormous article](https://therenegadecoder.com/code/python-code-snippets-for-everyday-problems/) up to date with all these snippets as well.
